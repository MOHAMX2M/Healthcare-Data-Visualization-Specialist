# Healthcare Data Visualization Initiative: A Strategic & Technical Framework
ðŸ“– Project Overview
This repository documents a comprehensive six-week internship project focused on developing a full-stack strategic and technical framework for healthcare data visualizations. The initiative moves from high-level strategic planning to the design of interactive prototypes, outlining a complete data workflow, and establishing a method for evaluating impact. The goal is to enhance data-driven decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and optimize operational efficiency within healthcare settings through effective visual communication.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Strategic Foundation: To analyze current healthcare data trends and create a strategic plan with clear objectives, KPIs, and a implementation roadmap.

User-Centered Design: To conceptualize and design intuitive, actionable dashboard prototypes tailored to the needs of specific healthcare audiences (e.g., clinicians, administrators, public health officials).

Robust Data Pipeline: To design a reliable, reproducible data preparation and visualization workflow that ensures data integrity and clarity from source to final visual.

Interactive Exploration: To develop plans for interactive visualizations that empower users to explore public health data and derive insights independently.

Impact Measurement: To create a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of visualizations on user engagement, comprehension, and decision-making, including strategies for continuous optimization.
